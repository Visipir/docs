**Key Difference: Mods vs. Plugins**

- Mods modify the game's core and MUST be installed on both the server AND on every player's computer.
- Plugins are server-side only; players don't need to install anything.

**Mandatory Prerequisites**

1. Server Must Use a Mod Loader Your server MUST run on Forge, Fabric, or Quilt. Vanilla or Spigot/Paper servers cannot run mods. You can usually select your server type in the "Startup" tab in Pterodactyl.
2. Players Must Also Install Mods Every player who wants to join MUST install the same mod loader (Forge/Fabric) and the exact same mods on their computer.

**Steps to Install Mods on the Server**

1. Find and Download Mods Download your desired mod files (they have a `.jar` extension) from a trusted source.
   - Trusted Sources: CurseForge, Modrinth.
   - IMPORTANT: Pay close attention to the Minecraft Version (e.g., 1.20.1) and the Mod Loader (Forge/Fabric) that the mod requires. Everything must match.
2. Open the File Manager In your Pterodactyl Panel, navigate to your server and click the "File Manager" tab.
3. Navigate to the `mods` Folder Find and open the folder named `mods`.
   - If this folder doesn't exist, your server type is likely incorrect (not Forge/Fabric). You can try creating it manually by clicking "New Folder".
4. Upload the Mod Files Inside the `mods` folder, click "Upload" and select all the mod `.jar` files you downloaded.
5. Restart the Server Go back to the "Console" page and click "Restart". The server must be restarted to load all the new mods.

**Mandatory Steps for Players**

- Ensure all players have installed Forge/Fabric on their computers.
- Players must copy the exact same mod `.jar` files into their `.minecraft/mods` folder in their Minecraft installation directory.
- Players must launch the game using the Forge/Fabric profile from the Minecraft Launcher.

**Verification**

- If a player tries to join without the correct mods, they will receive an error like _"Incompatible FML modded server"_ or _"mismatched mod channel list"_.
- You can check the Console log to ensure all mods have loaded successfully without errors.
