When a Minecraft server is set to `online-mode=false` in the `server.properties` file, it does not verify player accounts with Mojang's servers. This state is commonly known as **"offline mode"** and allows players who do not own a premium Minecraft account to join. However, this creates a **major security risk**: anyone can log in using any username, including an admin's or operator's account.

To mitigate this, you **must** use an authentication plugin. This plugin forces every player to register with a password on their first join and log in with that password every time they return.

This document will cover two popular plugins: **nLogin** and **LibreLogin**.

### **General Plugin Installation Steps**
The installation process is the same for both plugins. Follow the steps below:

1. **Download the Plugin**:
   - Go to the SpigotMC website and download the `.jar` file for your chosen plugin.
     - **nLogin**: [https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/nlogin.34233/](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/nlogin.34233/&authuser=3)
     - **LibreLogin**: [https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/librelogin.86143/](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/librelogin.86143/&authuser=3)
2. **Log in to the Control Panel**:
   - Open your server panel at [**panel.sapphire-cloud.org**](https://panel.sapphire-cloud.org/) and log in.
3. **Select Your Server**:
   - From the server list, click on the server where you want to install the plugin.
4. **Access the File Manager**:
   - In the server's navigation menu, select the **Files** menu.
5. **Open the Plugins Folder**:
   - Find and enter the `plugins` folder. This is where all server plugins are stored.
6. **Upload the Plugin**:
   - Click the **Upload** button and select the plugin's `.jar` file that you just downloaded. Wait for the upload to complete.
7. **Restart the Server**:
   - Return to the **Console** page and click the **Restart** button. This will load the new plugin and create its configuration folder.

After the server is back online, the authentication plugin is active. Now, let's discuss the details and setup for each plugin.

## **1. nLogin**
nLogin is a very popular, stable, and feature-rich authentication plugin. It has been used by thousands of servers and is proven to be reliable.

### **Explanation**
nLogin provides a robust `/register <password> <confirmPassword>` and `/login <password>` system. The plugin focuses on security with many additional features to protect your server from bots and account theft.

### **Advantages of nLogin**
- **Very Feature-Rich**: Includes CAPTCHA protection, anti-bruteforce, name restrictions, and other security features.
- **Highly Customizable**: Almost all messages and settings can be changed to your liking.
- **Database Support**: Supports SQLite (default) and MySQL for storing player data.
- **Session System**: Players don't need to log in repeatedly if they rejoin within a short time.

### **Disadvantages of nLogin**
- **Complex Configuration**: The vast number of options can be confusing for new server administrators.
- **Slightly Heavier**: Its many features make it a bit heavier than simpler alternatives.
- **Infrequently Updated**: While it still works well on the latest versions, the plugin is not updated often.

### **How to Set Up nLogin**
After you restart the server, a folder named `nLogin` will appear inside the `plugins` folder.

1. Open the `plugins/nLogin` folder.
2. The main file to edit is `config.yml`. Open this file.
3. **Some important settings you can change:**
   - **Changing Messages**: Open the `messages.yml` file to translate or change all messages sent by the plugin to players.
   - **Password Requirements**:
    ```YAML
    registration:
           password:
             minLength: 6 # Set the minimum password length
             maxLength: 32 # Set the maximum password length
         
    ```
   - **Enabling Login Sessions**: To prevent players from needing to log in every time.

     YAML

     ```
     sessions:
       enabled: true # Change to 'true' to enable
       timeout: 1800 # Time in seconds (1800 seconds = 30 minutes)
       verifyIp: true # The session will expire if the player's IP changes
     
     ```
4. After you finish editing, save the `config.yml` file and type `nlogin reload` in the server console or restart the server to apply the changes.

## **2. LibreLogin**
LibreLogin is a more modern, lightweight, and simpler alternative to nLogin. It's designed to be easy to use without sacrificing essential security features.

### **Explanation**
Just like nLogin, LibreLogin provides a registration and login system. Its main focus is on performance, ease of use, and a modern design, both in its code and configuration.

### **Advantages of LibreLogin**
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Designed for maximum performance, making it suitable for servers with limited resources.
- **Simple Configuration**: The `config.yml` file is very easy to understand and edit.
- **Modern**: It is actively developed and uses newer technologies.
- **Supports Modern Hashing**: Uses the highly secure Argon2 hashing algorithm for passwords.

### **Disadvantages of LibreLogin**
- **Fewer Features**: Lacks the extensive additional security features found in nLogin (e.g., no built-in CAPTCHA).
- **Less Suited for Large Servers**: Especially those that require complex, layered security features.

### **How to Set Up LibreLogin**
After restarting the server, a `LibreLogin` folder will appear in the `plugins` folder.

1. Open the `plugins/LibreLogin` folder.
2. Edit the `config.yml` file. Most default settings are good enough, but you might want to change a few things.
3. **Some important settings:**
   - **Changing Messages**: Just like nLogin, all messages are in the `messages.yml` file. You can translate them as needed.
   - **Session Duration**:

     YAML

     ```
     session:
       enabled: true # Usually true by default
       timeout: 30 # Time in minutes
     
     ```
   - **Password Security**:

     YAML

     ```
     security:
       password:
         min-length: 8 # Set the minimum password length
     
     ```
   - **Registration Limit per IP**: To prevent bots.

     YAML

     ```
     security:
       max-registrations-per-ip: 2 # Set the maximum number of accounts that can be registered from one IP address
     
     ```
4. Save your changes to `config.yml`. In-game, you can use the command `/librelogin reload` (requires OP privileges) or simply restart the server.

### **Conclusion: Which One Should You Choose?**
- Choose **nLogin** if you need **comprehensive security features**, deep customization, and don't mind a slightly more complex configuration.
- Choose **LibreLogin** if you want a **lightweight, fast, modern, and easy-to-setup** plugin for a small to medium-sized server.
