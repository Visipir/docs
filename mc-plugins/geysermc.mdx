### **Introduction: What are GeyserMC and Floodgate?**

- **GeyserMC:** A proxy that translates packets between Minecraft: Java Edition and Bedrock Edition. It's the core bridge that makes cross-play possible.
- **Floodgate:** A companion plugin for GeyserMC. It allows Bedrock players to join a server without needing to own a paid Java Edition account, creating a seamless experience.

For the best results, you should install **both** GeyserMC and Floodgate.

### **Prerequisites**

- Your server must be running a server type that supports plugins, such as **Paper**, **Spigot**, or their forks.
- You must have an **additional port** allocated to your server. Your server has a primary port for Java players (e.g., 25565), and you will need a second, different port for Bedrock players to connect through.

### **Step 1: Find Your Allocated Geyser Port**

Before downloading anything, you need to identify the port that Bedrock players will use.

1. Log in to the Sapphire Cloud panel at [**https://panel.sapphire-cloud.org**](https://panel.sapphire-cloud.org/).
2. Select the server you want to install GeyserMC on.
3. In the navigation menu, click on **Network**.
4. You will see a list of your server's allocated ports. Your primary port is the main one for Java connections. Note down one of the **additional ports** (e.g., `25577`, `19132`, etc.). This will be your Geyser port.

_(This is a generic example; your panel may look different)_

### **Step 2: Download GeyserMC and Floodgate**

1. Go to the official GeyserMC download page: [**https://geysermc.org/download**](https://geysermc.org/download).
2. Download the latest version of **Geyser** for your platform (e.g., `Geyser-Spigot.jar`).
3. Download the latest version of **Floodgate** for your platform (e.g., `Floodgate-Spigot.jar`).

You should now have two `.jar` files.

### **Step 3: Upload and Install the Plugins**

1. In the Sapphire Cloud panel, navigate to the **Files** tab.
2. Open the `plugins` folder.
3. Click the **Upload** button and upload both `Geyser-Spigot.jar` and `Floodgate-Spigot.jar`.
4. Once the uploads are complete, navigate to the **Console** page and **Restart** your server.

This first restart will generate the necessary configuration files for both plugins.

### **Step 4: Configure GeyserMC**

This is the most important step. You need to tell Geyser which port to use for Bedrock connections.

1. Go back to the **Files** manager.
2. Navigate to `plugins/Geyser-Spigot/`.
3. Find the file named `config.yml` and click to edit it.
4. Scroll down to the `bedrock:` section.
5. Change the `port:` value from the default (`19132`) to the **port you noted down in Step 1**.
6. Ensure the `address:` is set to `0.0.0.0`. This allows it to listen on the correct panel IP.

Here is what the section should look like:

```YAML config.yml
bedrock:
# The IP address that Geyser will listen on.
# Generally, you should NOT change this.
address: 0.0.0.0

# The port that Geyser will listen on for Bedrock players.
# This MUST be the additional port allocated to your server in the panel.
port: 25577 # <--- CHANGE THIS to your allocated port from Step 1
```

7. Click **Save Content**.

### **Step 5: Final Restart and Connect**

1. Go to the **Console** and **Restart** your server one more time to apply the configuration changes.
2. Your server is now ready for cross-play!

**How Players Connect:**

- **Java Edition Players:** Connect using your server's normal IP and primary port (e.g., `play.yourserver.com` or `123.45.67.89:25565`).
- **Bedrock Edition Players:** Connect using your server's IP and the **Geyser port** you configured (e.g., Server Address: `123.45.67.89`, Port: `25577`).

### **Common Issues**

- **Bedrock players can't connect:**
  - Double-check that the `port` in Geyser's `config.yml` exactly matches the additional port shown in your panel's **Network** tab.
  - Ensure you have restarted the server _after_ saving the configuration file.
- **Getting an error about "outdated client/server":**
  - Make sure you have downloaded the latest versions of GeyserMC and Floodgate. Geyser is updated frequently to support new Minecraft versions.
- **Bedrock player skins are not showing:**
  - This is expected for some setups. You may need to install an additional skin-restoring plugin if you wish to see Bedrock skins.
