description: "This guide will walk you through connecting a custom domain name to your Minecraft server, so players no longer need to type the IP address."

**1. Get Your Server IP and Port**

First, find the Numeric IP Address and Port of your server from the Pterodactyl Panel. For example: `123.45.67.89:25565`.

- IP: `123.45.67.89`
- Port: `25565`

**2. Log In to Your Domain's DNS Panel**

Go to the website where you purchased your domain (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy, Cloudflare) and navigate to its DNS management panel.

**3. Configure DNS Records**

You need to create two records: an A Record and an SRV Record.

Step 1: Create the A Record (Same as above)

- Type: `A`
- Name/Host: `play`
- Value/Points to: Your server's IP Address (`123.45.67.89`).

Step 2: Create the SRV Record This automatically handles the port redirection.

- Type: `SRV`
- Service: `_minecraft`
- Protocol: `_tcp`
- Name/Host: Enter the subdomain you just created (e.g., `play`).
- Target: Enter the full subdomain address (`play.yourdomain.com`).
- Priority: `0`
- Weight: `5`
- Port: Enter your server's Port (`25577`).
- TTL: Leave it as default.

Once saved, players can still connect using `play.yourdomain.com` (without typing the port).

**4. Wait for Propagation**

DNS changes need time to spread across the globe, usually taking anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours. Be patient. Afterwards, you can try connecting to your server in Minecraft using your new domain.
